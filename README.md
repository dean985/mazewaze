The Project divided into 3 main sections the *data structure* which build from node and adge with search runtime scale of O(n). *Algorithem* that contain methods to read from file and write to file, check the graph conectivity and shortest path to specific location on the graph from another.  

The data structure and the algorithem can be used for many purpus from navigation app such waze to network simulator.

for more information and usege guide take a look in repository's wiki.
